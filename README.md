This is small and rather crude implementation of non-tessellating grid theory. It contains a data type for non-tessellating grid traversals and an algorithm to convert the data type to a Cartesian point

Note that this is only for pentagons, and few chnages must be made to make it work with other non-tessellating polygons.
